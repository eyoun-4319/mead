		<h1> What is mead?</h1>
		<img src="images/450px-Swedish_Mead.jpg" alt="Mead" class="mead">
		<p>Mead is an alcoholic beverage brewed by mixing honey, water, and yeast. Of course, other ingredients, such as yeast nutrients, should be used to help taste and ferment. Mead is often referred to as "honey wine" and is often associated with Vikings, who primarily drank mead. The oldest trace of mead was found in China in 6500 B.C. and in Ireland around  2800 - 1800 B.C. <br><br>

		<h1> How is mead made?</h1>
		<img src="images/Sugar-wine.jpg" alt="Mead" class="mead">
		<p>Mead is brewed by mixing the following ingredients; honey, water (preferably spring), and yeast (preferably alcohol yeast, not bread). It sounds simple, but it is more challenging than mixing those three together and having a drinkable product in several weeks. In addition, other tools and ingredients are needed for a smoother and better-tasting brew. However, brewing mead is relatively easy if the proper research and equipment have been gathered. Of course, if you're looking at this from the subreddit/r/mead, you might already know this.
